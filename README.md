# iNoteBook

iNoteBook is a simple yet powerful MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) project designed to foster foundational full-stack development skills. This application offers users a secure and efficient way to manage their notes with essential CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, along with a robust user authentication system.

## Features

- **Secure Authentication**: Implemented using Bcrypt.js for password encryption and JSON Web Token (JWT) for user authorization.
- **CRUD Operations**: Users can create, read, update, and delete notes seamlessly.
- **Alert System**: Provides real-time feedback to users on their actions within the application.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed with simplicity and ease of use in mind, making it accessible to all users.

## How Safe is User Data?

iNoteBook takes user security very seriously. Passwords are encrypted using Bcrypt.js, converting them into hash codes that make it nearly impossible for unauthorized parties to access. Additionally, JWT is used to authorize users, ensuring that only authenticated users can access their data, which adds an extra layer of security.

## Why Should You Use iNoteBook?

iNoteBook is a reliable tool for managing your important data. Whether you're jotting down personal thoughts or keeping track of professional tasks, iNoteBook's straightforward features allow you to easily add, read, update, and delete your notes, all within a secure environment.
